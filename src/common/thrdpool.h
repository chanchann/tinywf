 * Thread pool originates from project Sogou C++ Workflow

 *
 * A thread task can be scheduled by another task, which is very important,
 * even if the pool is being destroyed. Because thread task is hard to know
 * what's happening to the pool.
 * The thread pool can also be destroyed by a thread task. This may sound
 * strange, but it's very logical. Destroying thread pool in thread task
 * does not end the task thread. It'll run till the end of task.
